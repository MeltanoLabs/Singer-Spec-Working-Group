# Proposal Documentation and Review

## Step 1: Open an Issue

First, open an issue to confirm the idea is viable and has some interest from the community.

## Step 2: Create the proposal doc

When you are ready to draft the proposal, copy the template into a new page with the next available SIP number and begin to fill out the document.

## Step 3: Discussion and Comment Period

After the doc is created, start a new Discussion thread to request feedback. Cross link the discussion thread to your SIP proposal and vice versa. When your proposal is ready for review, change the status to "Ready for Review" and post a note to the original issue.

## Step 4: Review Period

The working group will pick 2-4 topics each month to review. Once selected for review, update the doc status to "Reviewing" and enter the comment-by-date deadline here in the form.

## Step 5: Approval

Approval conditions are still TBD, but generally SIPs will be approved if consensus is reasonably gathered from the majority of working group members - and if there are no "Strong No" votes from the working group leadership team.
