## Proposal

### TL;DR Overview

A proposal for drafting, submitting, reviewing, and approving proposals.

### What specific change do you propose to make?

We propose a process for submitting proposals, as described here in this proposal.

------------------

#### Phase 1: Open an Issue

First, open an issue to confirm the idea is viable and has some interest from the community. Ask others to comment on your issue and provide their feedback.

#### Phase 2: Create the proposal doc

When you are ready to draft the proposal, create a new branch starting with the issue number followed by a dash (`-`). Copy the [document template](../template.md) and fill out the proposal template.

Commit to your branch, push, and then open a new PR that links back to your original issue.

#### Phase 3: Discussion and Comment Period

After the doc is created, start a new Discussion thread to request feedback. Cross link the discussion thread to your SIP proposal and vice versa. When your proposal is ready for review, change the status to "Ready for Review" and post a note to the original issue.

#### Phase 4: Review Period

The working group will pick 1-3 topics each month to review. Once selected for review, update the doc status to "Reviewing" and enter the comment-by-date deadline here in the form.

#### Phase 5: Approval

SIPs will be approved if consensus is gained from the majority of working group members - and if there are no "Strong No" votes from the working group leadership team.
