# Singer Spec Working Group

Working group for ongoing development and iteration of the Singer Spec, the de-facto protocol for open source data connectors.

Please use ["Issues"](https://github.com/MeltanoLabs/singer-spec-working-group/issues) to create work items - or use ["Discussions"](https://github.com/MeltanoLabs/singer-spec-working-group/discussions) for general questions or inquiries.

A Topics Board is [here](https://github.com/MeltanoLabs/singer-spec-working-group/projects/1), where you can see which topics are up next for discussion, which have recently been reviewed, etc. We also have a [Slack channel](https://meltano.slack.com/archives/C02A48LHQJH).
